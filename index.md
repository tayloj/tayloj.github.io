## Experience

### Chief Scientist, 2022--present

Siege Technologies  
Rome, NY

Work alongside Siege's Senior Leadership Team to provide technical
guidance for program execution, business development, and internal
research and development. Primary author of Siege's technical blog,
[Cyber Under
Siege](https://www.siegetechnologies.com/cyber-under-siege/). Continued
development of the Cyber Quantification Framework, and sustained
growth of Siege's semantic technologies group.

### Principal Software Engineer, 2020--2022

Siege Technologies  
Rome, NY

Led development of Siege's internal research and development
extensions to the Cyber Quantification Framework for commercialization
and a broader range of virtualization platforms.  Continued building
Siege's semantic technologies group, bringing in sufficient work to
support a team of engineers. Continued building customer and industry
relationships.

### Senior Software Engineer, 2014--2020

Siege Technologies  
Rome, NY

A primary developer of Siege's Cyber Quantification Framework (CQF)
for designing and executing cyber-experiments, data collection,
analysis, and AI/ML-based prediction of software behavior.  Also
participated in reverse engineering efforts. Initiated Siege's
ventures into semantic technologies in support of defense
applications.  Participated in business development, customer
interaction, and collaboration with industry partners.

### Research Engineer, 2011--2014

Assured Information Security  
Rome, NY

Worked in AIS's Decision Sciences and Analytics group, contributing to
a variety of efforts including semantic behavioral analysis of malware
and cyber-environment modeling for situational awareness. Mentored
other developers in semantic technologies (RDF, OWL, rule-based
reasoning).  Active in business development and proposals. Executed
internal research and development efforts.

### Graduate Research Assistant, 2008--2011

Department of Computer Science  
Department of Cognitive Science  
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  
Troy, NY, USA

Continued development of _Slate_ in support of the intelligence
community as well as for pedagogical use in Rensselaer's Introduction
to Logic and Intermediate Logic courses. Translations between logical
systems enabled students to use automated reasoners in one logic as
oracles within others (for instance, using an automated theorem prover
for first order logic to solve problems in modal logic using Kripke
frame semantics).

Translations between logics led to my PhD dissertation topic, _Fluid
Logics_, an approach to logic-based interoperability and proof
translation rooted in category theory.

Gained significant experience in proposal writing, especially for
government and defense programs, as well as proper documentation
procedures for the same, including adherance to technical report
guidelines.

<!-- A primary developer of
[Solomon](http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/solomon/){.system}, an advanced
question and answer dialogue system for intelligence analysts.  -->

### Graduate Research Assistant, 2005--2007

Department of Cognitive Science  
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  
Troy, NY, USA

A primary developer of _Slate_, a system for formal and informal
argument mapping, for use by professionals and students in the domains
of intelligence analysis and mathematics.

Graduate research in provability based interoperability culminated in
my MS thesis, [Provability-Based Semantic Interoperability Between
Knowledgebases and Databases via Translation
Graphs](jat.thesis.pdf). Worked with RAIR Lab colleagues and teams
from IBM, Stanford University, Pacific Northwest National

> Quantification Framework to automatically provision the networks
> used in the experiment, install the two moving target defenses,
> collect data, and analyze the results. We identify areas in which
> the costs and benefits of the two moving target defenses differ, and

> The vision of machines autonomously carrying out substantive
> conjecture generation, theorem discovery, proof discovery, and proof
> verification in mathematics and the natural sciences has a long
> history that reaches back before the development of automatic
> systems designed for such processes. While there has been
> considerable progress in proof verification in the formal sciences,
> for instance the Mizar project’ and the four-color theorem, now
> machine verified, there has been scant such work carried out in the
> realm of the natural sciences—until recently. The delay in the case
> of the natural sciences can be attributed to both a lack of formal
> analysis of the so-called “theories” in such sciences, and the lack
> of sufficient progress in automated theorem proving. While the lack
> of analysis is probably due to an inclination toward informality and
> empiricism on the part of nearly all of the relevant scientists, the
> lack of progress is to be expected, given the computational hardness
> of automated theorem proving; after all, theoremhood in even
> first-order logic is Turing-undecidable. We give in the present
> short paper a compressed report on our building upon these formal
> theories using logic-based AI in order to achieve, in relativity,
> both machine proof discovery and proof verification, for theorems
> previously established by humans. Our report is intended to serve as
> a springboard to machine-produced results in the future that have
> not been obtained by humans.

> Perhaps it is generally agreed that robots on the battlefield,
> especially if they have lethal power, should be ethically regulated.
> But in what does such regulation consist? Presumably in the fact that
> all the significant actions performed by such a robot are in
> accordance with some ethical code. But then the question arises as to
> *which* code. One possibility, a narrow one, is that the code is a set
> of *rules of engagement* affirmed by some nation or group. Another
> possibility is that the code is a utilitarian one represented in
> computational deontic logic, as explained elsewhere by Bringsjord and
> colleagues. Another possibility is likewise based on computational
> logic, but with a logic that captures some other mainstream ethical
> theory (e.g., Kantian deontology, or Ross' "right mix" direction).
> But there is another radically different possibility that hitherto has
> not arrived on the scene: viz., the controlling code could be viewed
> by the human as coming straight from God. There is some very rigorous
> work in ethics along this line, which is known as *divine-command
> ethics*. In a world in which human fighters and the general
> populations supporting them often see themselves as indeed championing
> God's will in war, divine-command ethics is quite relevant to
> military robots. This chapter introduces divine-command ethics in the
> form of the computational logic LRT^\*^, intended to eventually be
> suitable for regulating a real-world warfighting robot.

> Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR&R) is based on the idea
> that propositional content can be rigorously represented in formal

> representations can be productively reasoned over by humans and
> machines; and that this reasoning can be used to produce
> knowledge-based systems (KBSs). As such, KR&R is a discipline
> conventionally regarded to range across parts of artiﬁcial
> intelligence (AI), computer science, and especially logic. This
> standard view of KR&R's participating fields is correct --- but
> dangerously incomplete. The view is incomplete because, as we explain
> herein, sophisticated KR&R must rely heavily upon philosophy.
> Encapsulated, the reason is actually quite straightforward:
> Sophisticated KR&R must include the representation of not only simple
> properties, but also concepts that are routine in the formal sciences
> (theoretical computer science, mathematics, logic, game theory, etc.),
> and everyday socio-cognitive concepts like mendacity, deception,
> betrayal, and evil. Because in KR&R the representation of such
> concepts must be rigorous in order to enable machine reasoning (e.g.,
> machine-generated and machine-checked proofs that a is lying to b)
> over them, philosophy, devoted as it is in no small part to supplying
> analyses of such concepts, is a crucial partner in the overall
> enterprise. To put the point another way: When the knowledge to be
> represented is such as to require lengthy formulas in expressive
> formal languages for that representation, philosophy must be involved
> in the game. In addition, insofar as the advance of KR&R must allow
> formalisms and processes for representing and reasoning over visual
